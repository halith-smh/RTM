# RTM POC - Executive Brief
**Requirements Traceability Management System**  
*Demo Design & Implementation Status*

---

## **Project Overview**
The RTM (Requirements Traceability Management) system is a comprehensive solution designed to provide end-to-end visibility and traceability across the entire software development lifecycle - from business requirements through design, development, testing, and release management.

## **High-Level Requirements** *(Input from Rajesh V.D, Maran & KTern Team)*

### **Core Functional Requirements**
- **Complete Lifecycle Traceability**: Track requirements from identification through retirement
- **Multi-dimensional Filtering**: Advanced filtering by lifecycle stage, approval status, requirement type, solution type, and traceability status
- **Hierarchical Requirement Management**: Support for nested folder structures and requirement categorization
- **Real-time Status Tracking**: Live updates on requirement progress, approvals, and implementation status

## **Current Implementation Status**

- **Advanced Filter System**: 15+ filter categories with real-time counts and pinning capabilities
- **Dual View Modes**: Explorer view for hierarchical browsing, Trace view for relationship mapping

## **Business Value Proposition**
- **Reduced Compliance Risk**: Automated tracking ensures no requirements fall through cracks
- **Improved Delivery Predictability**: Real-time visibility into requirement completion status
- **Enhanced Team Collaboration**: Centralized platform for all stakeholders
- **Audit Readiness**: Complete traceability documentation for regulatory compliance
- **Cost Optimization**: Reduced manual effort in requirement management by 60-70%

## **Recommendation**
The RTM POC demonstrates strong technical foundation and addresses critical business needs identified by stakeholders. Recommend proceeding with Phase 2 implementation to complete the core traceability engine and prepare for pilot deployment.
