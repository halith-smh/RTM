- View requirements organized by business domains or project areas
- Expand/collapse folder trees for focused viewing

#### **Trace View**
- Visualize requirement relationships and dependencies

## **Tips for Maximum Efficiency**

### **Filter Strategy**
- Start broad, then narrow down with additional filters
- Pin your 3-4 most frequently used filters
- Use folder filters first to establish scope, then add attribute filters

### **View Selection**
- Use Explorer view for requirement discovery and organization
- Switch to Trace view when analyzing impacts or dependencies
- Customize columns based on your current task focus

### **Workflow Integration**
- Bookmark specific filter combinations for recurring tasks
- Use the system as your daily requirement dashboard
- Leverage real-time counts to prioritize work

---

## **Current Limitations & Workarounds**
- **Data Entry**: Currently optimized for viewing and analysis; use existing tools for requirement creation
- **Reporting**: Use filter combinations and column customization to create focused views for manual reporting
- **Bulk Operations**: Apply filters to identify requirement sets, then handle updates through existing processes

---

## **Support & Training**
- **Quick Reference**: Hover over filter options to see descriptions and counts
- **Navigation**: Use breadcrumbs to maintain context while exploring
- **Performance**: System handles 1000+ requirements smoothly with optimized filtering
